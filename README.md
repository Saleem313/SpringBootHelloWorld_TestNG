# Spring Boot + TestNG Unit Test Simple Example

In this project i have wrote test cases for a Spring Boot Application using TestNG.
TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit. 
It also introduces some new functionalities of its own that make it more powerful and easier to use. 
TestNG is an open source automated testing framework where NG means NextGeneration. 

**Following technologies being used**

- SpringBoot 4.0.6.RELEASE
- Maven 3
- JDK 1.8
- TestNG 6.8.5

:point_right: **for more advance use of unit testing you can reffer to [Simple Spring Hibernate Application Using Annotations](https://github.com/dilanka92/Spring4Hibernate)**
